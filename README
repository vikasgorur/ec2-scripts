Setup
-----

The tools require Ruby (>= 1.8.7) to be installed, along with the following Ruby gems:
    amazon-ec2 (https://github.com/grempe/amazon-ec2)

# gem update --system
# gem install amazon-ec2

The tools also require that two environment variables be set:

export AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

These should be set to your AWS API access keys.

Commands

Create a spot instance:

Usage: create-spot-instance -k KEY -o OWNER [-t TYPE] [-z ZONE] [-g GROUP] [-e DAYS] [-m ADDR] NAME
    -k, --key KEY                    SSH key name for the instance
    -o, --owner OWNER                Owner of the instance
    -t, --type TYPE                  Type of the instance (default: m1.large)
    -z, --zone ZONE                  Availability zone for the instance
    -g, --group GROUP                Security group (default: 'default')
    -e, --expires DAYS               Expiration period for the instance (in days)
    -m, --mail ADDRESS               E-mail address for reminders

The expiration period and reminder email address are needed for aws-cop to enforce them. If no such enforcement
is needed in your AWS account, you can choose to not specify them.

Terminate an instance:

Usage: terminate-instance -o OWNER NAME
    -o, --owner OWNER                Owner of the instance

List instances:

Usage: list-instances [-o <Owner>]
    -o, --owner OWNER                Show only instances belonging to given owner
    -e, --expired                    Show only expired instances

Modify expiry date:

Usage: modify-expiry-date -o OWNER [-p N] [-m N] NAME
    -p, --plus N                     Add N days to the expiry date
    -m, --minus N                    Subtract N days from the expiry date
    -o, --owner OWNER                Owner of the instance
